# Shooter-X
This was a 6-week project to built a top-down shooter game with Unity and coded in C#. Our team used agile methodologies such as stand-ups, Miro boards, and Kanban boards to manage our project.

Shooter-X is a top-down tatical shooter game. The player takes on the role of a soldier fighting against waves of enimies to stay alive in the single player mode. Or battling it out against other players in multiplayer. The game features  and health boosts scattered across the map to help you in the fight against enemies with advance AI tracking so there is no where safe you can hide.

## Agile Methodologies

### Stand-ups
We held daily stand-up meetings to ensure that everyone on the team was up-to-date with the progress of the project, discuss any blockers, and plan for the day ahead.

### Miro Board
We used Miro boards to create a visual representation of our project's progress, brainstorm ideas, and collaborate with one another.
